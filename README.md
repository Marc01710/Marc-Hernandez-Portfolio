# Marc-Hernandez-Portfolio

## Description

- My motivation came from wanting to put what I learned in the first and second module and putting my skills of HTML and CSS to use and making a portfolio website that I can have and update with future projects to be able to show future employers.
- I worked on this project to have a place to have my contact info and a list of projects that I have done to have a portfolio to show future employers.
- The problem that this project solves is having a webpage to be able to show people or employers the projects and skills I have learned while in this coding course.
- I learned that I am able to put the skills I learned in class to create a website for myself with my portfolio in it.
